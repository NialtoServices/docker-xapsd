# xapsd listens on this TCP socket for HTTP requests from the Dovecot plugin.
port: 11619

# Notifications from Dovecot caused by new messages are dispatched immediately, but notifications caused by moving,
# copying, or deleting messages are delayed for a few seconds. This allows us to batch up multiple notifications and
# dispatch them all at once, which is more efficient. If a new message arrives during the delay period, the held
# notifications are dispatched along with the new message notification immediately.

# The interval in seconds to check for delayed messages.
checkInterval: 20

# The number of seconds to wait before dispatching notifications for events other than new messages.
